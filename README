fnotify handles file change notifications.
On linux fnotify is implemented with inotify and
on mac os x and bsd's kevent is used.

Depending on how many libraries there are, a lot of 
filedescriptors may be consumed:

The way to add more file descriptors to processes on max os x is to:

   sysctl kern.maxfilesperproc

   	  To check maximum possible

   launchctl limit
   	  To check process limits

   launchctl limit maxfiles N N

   	  To set process limits - works sometimes..
